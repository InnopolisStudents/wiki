# Computer Architecture
>I think it’s fair to say that personal computers have become the most
>empowering tool we’ve ever created. They’re tools of communication,
>they’re tools of creativity, and they can be shaped by their user.
>>Bill Gates, February 24, 2004

The science and the art of **designing**, selecting, and interconnecting
**hardware components** and designing the hardware/software **interface**
to create a computing system that meets function, performance, energy consumption

## Why is architecture important?
* For the world
   * Computer architecture provides the engines that power all of
computing
* For You
   * As computer scientists, software engineers, and sophisticated users,
understanding how computers work is essential
   * The processor is the most important piece of this story
   * Many performance (and efficiency) problems have their roots in
architecture.

## Organization of the computer 
Each computing system consists of the following types of
components:
* Computational devices: one or many CPU cores, DSP, GPU
* Memory hierarchy: caches, memory controllers
* I/O devices, with memory-mapped registers
* Interconnect bus fabric that connects all computational and I/O
devices to the system memory via regular read and write requests
and DMA access from I/O device to the system memory
